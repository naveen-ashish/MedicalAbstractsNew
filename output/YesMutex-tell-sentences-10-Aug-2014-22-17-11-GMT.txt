Firstpass: Benzene induced hematopoietic neoplasms including myeloid leukemia in Trp53 deficient C57BL/6 and C3H/He mice|This research focused on three major questions regarding benzene induced hematopoietic neoplasms (HPNs)|First, why are HPNs induced equivocally and at only threshold level with low dose benzene exposure despite the significant genotoxicity of benzene even at low doses both in experiments and in epidemiology? Second, why is there no linear increase in incidence at high dose exposure despite a lower acute toxicity (LD(50) &gt|Background document for development of WHO Guidelines for Drinking Water Quality)? Third, why are particular acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs) not commonly observed in mice, although AMLs are frequently observed in human cases of occupational exposure to benzene? In this study, we hypothesized that the threshold like equivocal induction of HPNs at low dose benzene exposure is based on DNA repair potential in wild type mice and that the limited increase in HPNs at a high dose exposure is due to excessive apoptosis in wild type mice|To determine whether Trp53 deficiency satisfies the above hypotheses by eliminating or reducing DNA repair and by allowing cells to escape apoptosis, we evaluated the incidence of benzene induced HPNs in Trp53 deficient C57BL/6 mice with specific regard to AMLs|As a result, heterozygous Trp53 deficient mice of both strains showed a nonthreshold response of the incidence of HPNs at the lower dose, whereas both strains showed an increasing HPN incidence up to 100% with increasing benzene exposure dose, including AMLs, that developed 38% of heterozygous Trp53 deficient C3H/He mice compared to only 9% of wild type mice exposed to the high dose|

Firstpass: Immune suppression prevents renal damage and dysfunction and reduces arterial pressure in salt sensitive hypertension|The goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that renal infiltration of immune cells in Dahl S rats on increased dietary sodium intake contributes to the progression of renal damage, decreases in renal hemodynamics, and development of hypertension|In summary, in Dahl S rats on high sodium intake, treatment with MMF decreases renal NF kappaB and renal monocyte/macrophage infiltration and improves renal function, lessens renal injury, and decreases arterial pressure|This suggests that renal infiltration of immune cells is associated with increased arterial pressure and renal damage and decreasing GFR and renal plasma flow in Dahl salt sensitive hypertension|

Secondpass: We specifically studied whether anti immune therapy, using mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), could help prevent increases in renal NF kappaB activation, renal infiltration of monocytes/macrophages, renal damage, decreases in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal plasma flow, and increases in arterial pressure|3% Na rats and renal NF kappaB was 41% lower in 8% Na + MMF rats compared with the 8% Na group|MMF treatment significantly decreased renal monocyte/macrophage infiltration and renal damage and increased GFR and renal plasma flow|In high NA Dahl S rats mean arterial pressure increased to 182 +/  5 mmHg, and MMF reduced this arterial pressure to 124 +/  3 mmHg|

Secondpass: The prevalence of pervasive developmental disorders has increased in recent years|A statistically significant linear increase in pervasive developmental disorder prevalence was noted during the study period|Measles mumps rubella vaccination coverage averaged 93% during the study interval with a statistically significant decreasing trend from 96|Thus, pervasive developmental disorder rates significantly increased when measles mumps rubella vaccination uptake rates significantly decreased|The prevalence of pervasive developmental disorder in Montreal was high, increasing in recent birth cohorts as found in most countries|Factors accounting for the increase include a broadening of diagnostic concepts and criteria, increased awareness and, therefore, better identification of children with pervasive developmental disorders in communities and epidemiologic surveys, and improved access to services|The findings ruled out an association between pervasive developmental disorder and either high levels of ethylmercury exposure comparable with those experienced in the United States in the 1990s or 1  or 2 dose measles mumps rubella vaccinations|

Firstpass: However, increasing male breast cancer rates over the past three decades implicate additional sources of estrogenic exposure including wide spread estrogen mimicking chemicals or xenoestrogens (XEs), such as bisphenol A (BPA)|By exposing renewable, human, high risk donor breast epithelial cells (HRBECs) to BPA at concentrations that are detectable in human blood, placenta and milk, we previously identified gene expression profile changes associated with activation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway genesets likely to trigger prosurvival changes in human breast cells|Moreover, HRBECs pretreated with BPA, or the XE, methylparaben (MP), surmounted antiestrogenic effects of tamoxifen showing dose dependent apoptosis evasion and induction of cell cycling|Overall, XEs, when tested in benign breast cells from multiple human subjects, consistently initiated specific functional changes of the kind that are attributed to malignant onset in breast tissue|
